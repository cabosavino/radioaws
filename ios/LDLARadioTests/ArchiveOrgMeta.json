But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?","downloads":2483,"format":["Archive BitTorrent","Columbia Peaks","Item Tile","Metadata","Ogg Vorbis","PNG","Spectrogram","VBR MP3"],"identifier":"Taudio.siteHarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets","indexflag":["index","nonoindex"],"item_size":831929542,"mediatype":"audio","month":914,"oai_updatedate":["2018-11-20T00:38:54Z","2018-11-20T00:38:54Z","2018-12-28T22:09:39Z"],"publicdate":"2018-11-20T00:38:54Z","stripped_tags":["p class=\"separator\" style=\"margin:0px;clear:both;\"","font color=\"#ff0000\" face=\"inherit\"","a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W4h0GK232pG2XRa4_UJZ8fOYDJfM9za7\" style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\" rel=\"nofollow\"","font","a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CvgCmwkS0IxoVZ_1HkWycTWtSKQSD5ZF\" style=\"margin:0px;padding:0px;\" rel=\"nofollow\"","a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tfTIkAtIGOf5Mr3GL15ABnQbwg1wX2Ju\" rel=\"nofollow\"","a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zYNLnWpdyoc3dosKTby8eEbNqNoLn7Lj\" rel=\"nofollow\"","a href=\"https://archive.org/download/WutheringHeightsFullTAudio/Wuthering%20Heights%20full%20T-audio.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\"","p style=\"margin:0px;\""],"subject":["Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets audiobook","taudio"],"title":"Taudio.site Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets audiobook"},{"btih":"9f04039235fdc8d1d25a9d36eb6f7c3bc3df86d9","collection":["opensource_audio"],"description":"Best Audiobook Apps 2018: Taudio This is Android Application for Online audiobook Stream.audiobook Played and Download also that file example: Stephen King,harry potter,Twilight,The Lord of the Rings \u2026..

Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin! Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone is also available as an Illustrated Kindle-in-Motion edition. Amazon.com Review Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the nonmagic human world--the world of \"Muggles\"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: \"We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\" Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, \"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, first published in England as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, continues to win major awards in England. So far it has won the National Book Award, the Smarties Prize, the Children's Book Award, and is short-listed for the Carnegie Medal, the U.K. version of the Newbery Medal. This magical, gripping, brilliant book--a future classic to be sure--will leave kids clamoring for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. (Ages 8 to 13) --Karin Snelson From Publishers Weekly Readers are in for a delightful romp with this award-winning debut from a British author who dances in the footsteps of P.L. Travers and Roald Dahl. As the story opens, mysterious goings-on ruffle the self-satisfied suburban world of the Dursleys, culminating in a trio of strangers depositing the Dursleys' infant nephew Harry in a basket on their doorstep. After 11 years of disregard and neglect at the hands of his aunt, uncle and their swinish son Dudley, Harry suddenly receives a visit from a giant named Hagrid, who informs Harry that his mother and father were a witch and a wizard, and that he is to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry himself. Most surprising of all, Harry is a legend in the witch world for having survived an attack by the evil sorcerer Voldemort, who killed his parents and left Harry with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. And so the fun begins, with Harry going off to boarding school like a typical English kid?only his supplies include a message-carrying owl and a magic wand. There is enchantment, suspense and danger galore (as well as enough creepy creatures to satisfy the most bogeymen-loving readers, and even a magical game of soccerlike Quidditch to entertain sports fans) as Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione plumb the secrets of the forbidden third floor at Hogwarts to battle evil and unravel the mystery behind Harry's scar. Rowling leaves the door wide open for a sequel; bedazzled readers will surely clamor for one.

Versi audiobook (mp3) dan eBook (PDF) HP7 tersedia juga di C2O. Klab Baca #2 dihadiri oleh Rendy Ismail, Devi Lilasari, Ary Amhir, Ari Kurniawan, Anitha Silvia, Kathleen Azali, dan dimoderatori oleh Andriew Budiman. Sebelumnya, menunggu peserta datang, film Harry Potter 7 (part 1) diputar di TV. Selain itu, kita juga bermain tebak-tebakan Alphabet Soup dari karakter dan benda-benda dalam Harry Potter. Kebanyakan peserta mengenal Harry Potter pertama-tama di masa mereka SMA. Ada yang tertarik karena sampulnya yang asik, ada yang awalnya ogah kemudian kecanduang juga setelah membaca. Kedetilan setting Harry Potter, yang terasa sangat begitu tervisualkan, menjadi salah satu daya tariknya, yang menurut peserta menyebabkan pembaca begitu mudah tenggelam di dalam ceritanya. Selain itu, juga dialog dan jalan pikiran yang catchy. Severus Snape ternyata menjadi pilihan banyak orang sebagai karakter favorit. \u00e2Karakternya kompleks, sampai akhir kita tidak bisa menebak dia berpihak pada siapa. Dan loyalitasnya luar biasa--dia bisa tetap setiap pada Lily dan Harry.\u00e2 ungkap Randy. Semua peserta setuju bahwa buku ini bukan sekedar buku anak-anak--bahkan, sampulnya saja dibuat versi dewasa dan anak-anak. Dan, buku ini dengan tanpa menggurui mengajarkan pada kita untuk melihat situasi secara lebih kompleks, tidak satu sisi, dan bahwa hidup adalah pilihan. ------------- Jadual pertemuan Klab Buku: Jumat keempat tiap bulan, pk. 18.00 28 Oktober 2011 : Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows (PIC: Andriew Budiman) 25 November 2011 : Saksi Mata (PIC: Antonio Carlos) 27 Januari : Sang Fotografer (PIC: Ary Amhir) Buku apa saja yang akan dibaca?
